# Program a weather application in Python
I used openweathermap API to get the data about the current weather of over 200.000 cities <br />
<br />
Simple Python code is placed in WeatherApplication.py (WeatherApp.ipynb is the same but I run it on googe colab, if you want to try it just open it and click open in colab) with sending API request, working with the console to get output<br />
<br />
In WeatherApplicationGUI.py, I used a built-in Python library called Tkinter to upgrape my application. It looks better than the WeatherApplication.py with all the images demostrate the conditions of the weather.I set the background of my application to mountain.png <br />
<br />
See all of the weather condition images in img
